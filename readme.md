You are *Hero*, the captain of team human and your goal is to win the intergalactic tournament to save your race and your planet from the evil aliens. You will have to fight the alien races teams in ice hockey matches over several landscape accross the galaxy. Manage, train and level up your team to prepare for the ultimate match that will decide the fate of humanity. Explore strange alien places and cities to discover and buy new equipment to help you in your quest.

### Battle plot beats

Battles are driven by a series of plot beats during which you can decide commands to execute in order to defeat your opponent. The types and nature of commands you can choose from is dictated by the plot beat you are in and the various skills of your players, depending on their class/position/weapons/equipment/etc. Plot beats represent different situation during a hockey game like faceoff, defense, attack, battles, penalties, story events etc. Plot beats are the result of the outcomes of your actions and of the story during the battle.

### Commands

During the battle, you will be alloted a certain amount of points to execute commands. Each command has some points attributed to it and the total number of points of the commands you choose cannot exceed your alloted amount. After you confirm your commands your energy bar is emptied and your command actions are executed. The energy bar gradually fills up. Once the bar is full, you are alloted a new amount of points that you can spend on new commands.

Both teams have their own energy bar that can be seen. Choosing when to execute your commands can be strategicaly timed in order to counter or prevent your enemy's actions.
